I'm a software engineer with over 20 years of experience building web applications, backend systems, and cloud infrastructure.

I've worked across startups, enterprises, and consulting—which means I've seen what works and what doesn't at every scale.

## What I do

- Full-stack web development
- Backend systems and APIs
- Cloud architecture and DevOps

## How I work

**Clean code** — Maintainable and extensible, not just functional

**Direct communication** — No layers, no handoffs. You work with me.

**Quality over speed** — I'd rather do it right than do it twice
